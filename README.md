Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This is a very simple twitter sentiment analysis code. I created with help from youtube and projectlearn.io.

The program uses the Twitter API (You will need elevated access) through the tweepy library to extract tweets with a given word from the user. Then it uses the textblob library to do the sentiment analysis on the particular tweets.
